Contemporary Art Research Essay (CityU Hong Kong) - September to December 2024

"How does David Rokeby's Very Nervous System utilise the concept of the 'disappearing interface' to redefine the participant's role in interactive art, and what does this reveal about the evolving relationship between human perception and technology?”

This project demonstrates my ability to critically engage with the intersection of art, technology, and human perception. It examines how David Rokeby’s Very Nervous System utilises the concept of the "disappearing interface" to redefine participant engagement in interactive art. Through this analysis, I explore how emerging technologies blur the boundaries between human action and machine response, revealing the evolving dynamics of perception, agency, and technology.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Analytical thinking and research.
- Understanding of computational art and interactive media.
- Ability to link theoretical concepts with real-world examples.
- Clear and compelling written communication.
  
This critical analysis reflects my ability to merge theoretical concepts with practical examples in computational art. By exploring the interplay between perception and technology, I gained deeper insights into how interactive systems can transform human engagement with art. These insights inspire my approach to creating art that challenges conventional boundaries and fosters dynamic interaction.
Rokeby’s Very Nervous System demonstrates the potential of computational art to reshape human perception and agency. This project showcases my passion for exploring the intersection of art and technology, and my ability to critically analyse and reflect on the evolving relationship between humans and machines.
